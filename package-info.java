// This code combines the differential evolution algorithm with novelty search to train a neural network
// controlled robot to navigate through a maze. Two mazes are implemented here.

// Please use the following bib file to cite the paper describing this algorithm, presented at the ALA
// workshop at the 2018 Federated AI Meeting (ICML, AAMAS and IJCAI) in Stockholm, Sweden
